## Tech
Components library uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) - JavaScript library for creating native apps for Android and IOS using React.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html) - Strongly typed programming language which builds on JavaScript
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Allows execute javascript scripts on the terminal
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - Development environment for UI components
- [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/) - library for dealing with dates and times in JavaScript (better alternative than Moment.js)
- [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Library to style react components
- [react-native-svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-svg) - Provides SVG support to React Native on iOS and Android, and a compatibility layer for the web
- [create-react-native-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-native-library) - CLI to scaffold React Native libraries

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute to the repository and the development workflow.

Make sure your messages look like the following examples
```
feat: Adding new badge component
fix: Touchable component not being exported correctly
fix!: Drop support for Typescript
```
_Note that the last one will generate a Major commit. It has the same result as adding a breaking change footer_

Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) to update project version.

[Release-It](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) will take care of versioning, you just have to give the correct type to commit:

- **fix** - to indicate a bug fix (PATCH) ex . v0.0.1
- **feat** - to indicate a new feature (MINOR) ex. v0.1.0
- **chore** - for updates that do not require a version bump (.gitignore, comments, etc.)
- **docs** - for updates to the documentation
- **BREAKING CHANGE** - regardless of type, indicates a Major release (MAJOR) ex. v1.0.0

Visit [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for more examples.

**Make a release**
Run following command after your last commit/amend. Then answer with Y/N the prompt
```bash
yarn release
```
